# Putnam.putnam_2005_a4 — imported from PutnamBench

Original theorem: `putnam_2005_a4` (Putnam 2005 A4).

## Statement

Let $H$ be an $n \times n$ matrix all of whose entries are $\pm 1$ and whose rows are mutually orthogonal. Suppose $H$ has an $a \times b$ submatrix whose entries are all $1$. Show that $ab \leq n$.

The formal statement is pinned in `Root.lean` (`theorem main`).
No solution abbrev — pure proof task.

## Strategic notes

Imported via `Benchmarks/putnambench/adapter.py` from
trishullab/PutnamBench @ a23d8e6. No per-problem hints —
benchmark integrity. The pinned statement is never edited;
if you believe it is FALSE, that is what `AttemptDisproof` /
`RequestUserAmend` are for.
