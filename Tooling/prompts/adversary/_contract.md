## The Strategist's contract (verbatim)

The decision-kind rules the Strategist operates under — check quoted contract clauses against THESE, not the proposal's paraphrase:

- `Inject` — `brief` or `brief_file` (bare filename in your attempts dir — Write the brief there, no JSON escaping). Two shapes:
  - With `target_goal_id`: work that goal. The worker chooses prove-directly vs decompose itself — steer with the brief's mathematics, not a mode.
  - Without `target_goal_id`: mint ONE new def/theorem into `proofs/L_<slug>.lean` (snake_case slug). Search for an existing lemma first. Do not add defs via `Defs.lean`. Never brief a mint with an alive goal's statement.
- `ConfirmShelve` — `target_goal_id`, `reason`. First shelve pairs with an `Inject`; re-confirming an already-shelved goal stands alone (the batch still needs its ≥1 experiment). Shelve parks the goal (revivable) and cascades only DOWN to its descendants — it never kills an ancestor or the root.
- `EmitDirective` — `scope="problem:<name>"`, `body` or `body_file` (bare filename in your attempts dir — Write the text there, no JSON escaping), `reason`. Standing hints EVERY worker reads on EVERY spawn; keep it short and general (conventions, footguns). Your plans/progress go in `_plan.md`; goal-specific hints in an Inject brief.
- `AttemptDisproof` — `target_goal_id`, `reason` (falsity evidence). For a user-requested claim you believe false; a typo → `RequestUserAmend` instead. The framework mints the mechanical `¬` goal and dispatches it — no companion `Inject` needed.
- `MarkDeliverable` — `target_goal_id`, optional `reason`. Flag a landed node as a top-level *deliverable*. Only a minted node (no-target Inject) can be marked, and only once it satisfies what the Manifest asked for. Do not mark the definitions the deliverable depends on — the framework computes those and presents them to the user.
- `Ingest` — optional `reason`. The problem's only exit: emit once the Manifest is fully satisfied. Requires a proved root when one exists (a proved root also counts as the deliverable). Never in the same batch as its `MarkDeliverable`s — mark first; the framework re-wakes you immediately and you Ingest then. A disproved requested claim never satisfies the Manifest — `RequestUserAmend` with the disproof instead.
- `RequestUserAmend` — `problem`, `file ∈ {"Defs.lean", "Manifest.md", "Root.lean"}`, `proposed_body`, `question`, `reason`. Only when a user file is wrong.
- `Noop` — `reason`. Only when work is genuinely in flight; rejected when the root is blocked.
- Framework: an Inject whose statement matches an existing in-problem goal is auto-reused, not minted fresh — a **proved** twin is aliased; an **alive / parked** twin links to it (the inject then rides that goal's lifecycle). A reshaped statement of a goal that already exists is that goal, not a new lemma.

`target_goal_id` accepts integer id or slug.
